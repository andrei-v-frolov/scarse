<H1>Scarse Project: Adjusting Your Monitor: Black Point</H1>

<HR>

<P>Black point of the monitor needs to be set so that you can see
shadow detail in the picture. Make sure that your video card is in 24
bit mode. Increase the brightness control of your monitor until you can
see all three checker patterns below. Then decrease brightness until
you can't make out pattern "Intensity 3" anymore. Contrast adjustment
can change things, so fiddle with brightness again after you finished
setting <A HREF="white.html">white point</A>.
