Scarse (Scanner CAlibration ReaSonably Easy)  --  to do list
============================================================

To do next:
===========

  -- Use FreeImage library for portable image I/O
  -- Add display and printer calibration support
  -- Write GUI frontend to calibrate (using Tk/Tcl)
  -- Implement automatic color patch grid positioning
  -- Write up documentation


In the future:
==============

  -- Make cmap and calibrate into Gimp plugins
     (this would have to wait until Gimp supports different color
      spaces and more than 8 bits/channel)
