<H1 ALIGN=center>Test Gradients</H1>

Below are greyscale linear gradients converted to several different
gamma values. They should appear very smooth, with continuous
transition from pure black to bright white. The grey tones should be
completely neutral, without tint of any color. The gradient
corresponding to your system gamma should appear "most linear", with
mid-tone grey exactly in the middle.

<P>If you can see wide bands of the same color, it means that you video
card is in low-color mode. Switch it to 24 bit or higher mode. This is
an object lesson on why do you <I>need</I> video card that supports 24
bit mode at your favourite resolution to view photographs. Banding will
spoil your fun, especially with black and white images. (24 bit color =
8 bit greyscale = 256 shades of grey, while 15 bit color = 5 bit
greyscale = 32 shades of grey. Give me a break...) Avoid 16 bit mode,
as it gives greys that are not neutral, because one color gets one more
bit than others.
