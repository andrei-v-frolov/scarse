White point of the monitor needs to be set so that highlights in the
picture are not blown out. Make sure that your video card is in 24 bit
mode. Increase contrast until you get the desired brightness of the
white color. You should see all three checker patterns below clearly.
If you lose detail in patterns "Intensity 8" and/or "Intensity 3", tune
the contrast down a bit. Getting detail in the highlight should not be
a problem for a quality monitor. My Trinitron ViewSonic starts to glow
way to bright to look at before highlights are blown out. You may have
to fiddle with <A HREF="black.html">black point</A> again, if the
contrast and brightness controls are linked on your monitor.
