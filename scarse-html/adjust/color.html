Color calibration is really impossible to do without some standard
hard-copy color chart reference. The things are futher complicated by
the different color spaces different devices use. It's a big topic, and
a lot of commercial companies rake in dollars providing ready to use
solutions. I don't have enough experience to tell you how to
color-calibrate your system, so you'll just have to figure it out for
yourself. On the bright side, look at the test patterns below and enjoy
pretty colors :).

<P>Primary colors should appear clean and clear, grays neutral, and
transitions between colors in hue charts continuous and really smooth.
If there is banding, you are in low-color mode. A lot can be learned
about your monitor/video card just by looking at <A
