<H1>Convergence and Moire</H1>

Don't bother to fiddle with these ones if you don't know what you are
doing. A lot of cheaper monitors do not even have these controls. Most
of them will fail these tests miserably.

<H3>Convergence</H3>

Convergence refers to the alignment of the red, green, and blue electron
guns inside your CRT. If they are out of alignment, color fringes on the
edges of high contrast will appear. Look at the test targets below.
Colored lines should align perfectly with each other, and no color
fringing should be apparent.

<H3>Moire</H3>

Moire is the coarse pattern appearing when viewing fine-stippled images.
Just take a look at the test target below and see what I mean. Some good
(and expensive) monitors have control that reduces appearance of the
moire pattern. If you have one of those, good for you :).
