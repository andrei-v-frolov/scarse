<P>Before you start working with photo images on your computer (or even
view them), you should really make sure that your video system is
displaying things correctly. These pages will assist you in this task
by providing patterns to test different things. To calibrate the video
system properly you really need some sort of hard-copy reference
points, so perhaps the better title would be "Adjust Your System".

<P><HR>

<P>If you intend to view or manipulate photo images using the computer,
you absolutely need to get video card that can support high-color mode
(24 bits/pixel or higher) at a decent resolution, say 1024x768 pixels.
Fortunately, most of the current video cards have enough memory to do
it. Unfortunately, most cheap video cards won't do it well. High
quality (and usually more expensive) cards offer better and faster
RAMDACs, which really helps, as well as extra hardware goodies, such as
built-in gamma-correction, which are usefull for photo imaging. And
don't forget about monitor. This is the part of the computer you see
the most. Don't skimp on it. Your eyes will thank you if you get a good
one.

<P>So, you got this latest and greatest video card and monitor combo,
but the photos you see on the Net still do not look so good. What
gives? Well, maybe it's because they are not so good. Check out <A
HREF="http://photo.net/photo/">photo.net</A> if you want to see what
does the quality photo scan mean. But maybe your systems requires some
tuning to perform at its best. So, what do you do now?

<P>First, make sure that your video card is running in <STRONG>high
color mode</STRONG>. If it isn't, switch the modes! Consult your system
documentation to find out how to do it. You want at least 24
bits/pixel. 15 bits/pixel will do in a pinch, but don't expect great
tonal gradation. Avoid 16 bits/pixel modes, they produce non-neutral
grays, as one color (green) gets 1 more bit than the others.

<P>Now it's time to adjust your monitor. All these buttons and dials on
it actually do something, they are not there just to impress the
consumers. Below are some suggestions on what to do with them. If you
know what you are doing, just ignore my ramblings and look at the test
patterns. I made them to help me adjust my own monitor, but perhaps
they will help you too.


<H3>Geometric Distortions</H3>

<P>The first thing you should do after your monitor syncs to the new
video mode is to adjust position and size of the image on the screen.
You can do it either the easy way, using the monitor controls, or the
hard way, reprogramming the timer chip of your video card. (If you are
unfortunate enough to run one of those so-called "user-friendly" OSes,
the later is not an option. It's already been decided that you are too
dumb to talk to your own hardware. No use protesting now...) I
personally would not use monitor controls for extreme adjustments. Let
the video card do its work, and set timing parameters right for your
monitor.

<P>After the size and the position of the image are roughly set, you
should check if there are any <A HREF="geometry.html">geometric
distortions</A>, and get rid of them if they are present. It's often
impossible to eliminate geometric distortions completely over the
entire image area, no matter how hard you try. You fix one thing and
the other one goes wrong. Very frustrating. This is partly the reason I
like to fiddle with timing signals instead of position controls. It
seems that geometric distortions are much easier to control if the
timing is agreeable with your monitor.

<H3>Determine System Gamma</H3>

<P>If you are into computer imaging, you probably already heard the
term "system gamma" used. It is surronded by obscurity and mistique and
separates Those Who Know from the rest of us. So what the heck is it?

<P>Actually it's really simple. Monitors, which are built around
cathode ray tubes, have non-linear brightness response to the input
signal value. Intensity <I>I</I> depends on input signal <I>V</I> by
power law
<P ALIGN=center><IMG SRC="power.gif" ALT="I=(aV+b)^gamma">,
<P>where exponent <I>gamma</I> is the same for all tubes and has value
5/2. Parameters <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> are basically set by contrast and
brightness controls. Scanners (and other input sources), on the other
hand, typically have linear signal response to light intensity. This
poses a problem: If you scan something and then display the result on
CRT, the image will not look like the original, as midtones will be
darkened. To compensate, you have to build in power-law correction
somewhere between source and output with exponent that adds up to 2/5.

<P>The trouble is that nobody seems to agree on where to put this
compensation. PC people bravely ignore the issue and leave correction
to software (system gamma 2.5), Mac crowd is proud to have partial
correction implemented in hardware (system gamma 1.8), while some
systems go for full correction in hardware (anyone remembers NeXT?).
Video standards for historical reasons expects system gamma 2.2, and
Kodak Photo CD sides with video on the issue. As long as you work with
one system, you don't care how the correction is split between hardware
and software, but when you start transferring files from one system to
another, the difference in software compensation expected bites you.
The whole mess is further complicated by the fact that other output
devices, like printers and such, also have non-linear responses with
different gammas.

<P>So what's a poor photographer to do? Actually, as long as you know
<A HREF="gamma.html">gamma of your system</A>, you are in a good shape.
Just apply appropriate gamma-correction in software whenever you want
to transfer files to systems with other gamma. However, if you do it
often enough it might become annoying, so you might consider setting
your system gamma to whatever everyone else has in your heck of the
woods. No need to switch computer systems - most high end video cards
feature programmable hardware gamma correction. You just have to figure
out how to talk to yours. I'm collecting <A
HREF="/db/comments/photo/calibrate/gamma">specific instructions</A> on
how to set system gamma for various machines. Please contribute if you
know how to set yours.

<P>If you did not reach Enlightenment after reading this (rather terse
and technical, I'm afraid) account of gamma, try the these links
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.cgsd.com/papers/gamma.html">CGSD - Gamma Correction Home Page</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://photo.net/photo/fixing-gamma.html">Fixing Gamma from photo.net</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/daiHome/techInfo/pcd-045.shtml">PhotoYCC Color Encoding and Compression Schemes</A>
</UL>
CGSD page in particular goes to great length trying to explain the
concept of gamma in words. I'm a physics guy, and find one formula much
clearer than ten pages of hand-waving and leg-dragging. If exact
sciences are not your forte, you might like their explanation better.

<P>Also take a look at <A HREF="gradient.html">grayscale gradients</A>
to test your gamma calibration.

<H3>Set Black and White Points</H3>

<P>After you sorted out system gamma issue, you should set <A
HREF="black.html">black</A> and <A HREF="white.html">white</A> points
for you monitor. This is just a fancy way of saying that you should
adjust brightness and contrast to ensure that the shadows do not
block and the highlights are not burnt out. Pretty straightforward
thing, but often forgotten. You might be surprised how much better
images will look after you do it.

<H3>Calibrate Color</H3>

<P>Calibrating color on the computer system is another hard topic. To
do it properly, from scanner to display to printer, you need a lot of
knowledge about how color works in digital world, some hardcopy
reference points, and a great deal of patience. I am working on a <A
HREF="/scarse/">free color calibration software project</A>, but it is
still in early alpha, and not for a faint of heart. You might prefer to
bravely ignore the issue, and look at <A HREF="color.html">some pretty
color targets</A> instead to see if there is something obviously amiss.
You might also wish to set overall color balance of your monitor at
this time. Color temperature of 5400K is what the daylight is balanced
at, so that's what you should set you monitor color control to. Some
monitors default to much cooler color rendition (9000K and up), which I
dislike as it tires my eyes quickly.

<H3>Final Touches</H3>

<P>By now images should start looking good on your screen, but there is
still some fine tuning to be done. Scout your monitor controls (and
documentation) for more advanced things that can be adjusted, like
<A HREF="convergence.html">convergence and moire</A>. But don't overdo
things and try to fix something that isn't broke. Factory defaults are
usually sane for these esoteric controls.
