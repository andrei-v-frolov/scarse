<H1 ALIGN=center>System Gamma</H1>

System gamma can be determined by finding midtone gray that matches in
intensity with stippled black and white pattern. Make sure that your
video card is in at least 24 bit mode. 15 and 16 bit modes do not have
enough shades of gray to get any precision, not to mention 8 bit mode.
Than make sure that black areas are fully black. Especially check edge
of the display where there is no picture. Dim the brightness to get
them black if they are not.

<P>Now look at the test targets below. The stippled areas should appear
crisp, and the midtone gray areas continuous. If the stippled pattern
is bleeding, and the edges are not sharp, reduce the resolution of the
monitor. Now by eye-balling pick the target on which gray tone and
stippled pattern appear of equal intensity. Squinting your eyes and
moving your head from side to side helps to see fine differences. The
number below that target is your system gamma. It will probably be
somewhere in 1.8 - 2.5 range, depending on your hardware configuration.
The rest of the targets are there just to take up the space :).
