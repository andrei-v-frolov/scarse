Here is what Scott has to say about them:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CITE>
  These images were scanned from high quality, closed loop systems from
  manufacturer supplied 6x7 reference portrait film sets. These are about
  as good as scans get from negatives as far as dynamic range and tonal
  fidelity. Both images are approx 380x450 by 24-bit uncompressed TIF
  file. The JPEG compression algorithm distorts the tonal range so I
  choose not to upload these images in that format.
  
  <P>
  I provided these images because the main problem I see with novice
  scanner users and new digital capture camera owners is a lack of
  knowing what a good image looks like. Most digital scans on the
  internet lack correct contrast correction - hopefully these fleshtone
  images will correct that. They are also great for doing SUBJECTIVE
  calibrations of monitors and ink-jet printers.
  
  <P>
  NOTE: It's not a good idea to open these images with your browser. I
  strongly adivise saving them to your hard-drive and opening them with
  your paint program.
