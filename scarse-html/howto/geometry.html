<H1>Scarse Project: How To...: Geometry Specification for Test Targets</H1>

<HR>

<P>
Scarse builds calibration profiles for your scanner by comparing actual
raw scan of the test target with the colors it is supposed to have. To
do that, it has to know where same-color patches are located on the
scan. Typically, they are arranged on a rectangular grid. But the grid
size and position in the scan is not fixed, as image area can be
shifted and cropped. So, you must tell Scarse where the grid is on your
particular scan. You do this by specifying grid <I>geometry</I> (like
in X), not in pixels, but in percent of the total image dimensions
(this is to make translation to different resolution scan easier). Here
is an example:


<H3 ALIGN=center>Q60 calibration target</H3>

<P ALIGN=center><IMG WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=324 SRC="q60-geom.jpg" ALT="Q60E3 target">

<P>
Above is a scan of Kodak Q60E3 calibration target, with grid corners
marked by bright red triangles (other Q60 targets are exactly like
Q60E3). The grid takes up 84.2% of the width and 84.1% of the height of
the scan, and is offset by 8.8% from the left and by 5.1% from the top.
So the full geometry specification for the above scan is
<PRE>
	-g 84.2x84.1+8.8+5.1
</PRE>
You should find corners in <I>your</I> scan and work out numbers in a
similar way. Or just crop the image to the corners, and say
<PRE>
	-g 100x100+0+0
</PRE>

<P>
Eventually, when the GUI frontend is written, this boring step will be
made automatic. But for now, you have to suffer...
