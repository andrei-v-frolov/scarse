Scarse (Scanner CAlibration ReaSonably Easy)  --  installation
==============================================================

Quick installation notes:
=========================

This is a first alpha release, so it is rough around the edges.
Not everything is automated, or working smoothly for that matter,
so you will have to exercise discretion.


To compile:
===========

Edit makefiles to suit your machine, then do 'make' in the top
directory. This will make icclib and scarse binaries. By default,
icclib is compiled and linked to as a shared library. You might
have to rerun 'ldconfig' after it is installed to make ld.so find
it.


To install:
===========

Do 'make install' in the top directory. This will install icclib
and scarse binaries into directory specified by $(PREFIX) variable
in makefiles. No additional data files are required for operation,
all calibration target data is precompiled into binaries.
