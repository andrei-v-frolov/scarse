Scarse (Scanner CAlibration ReaSonably Easy)  --  installation
==============================================================

Quick installation notes:
=========================

This is still an alpha release, so it is rough around the edges.
Not everything is automated, or working smoothly for that matter,
so you will have to exercise discretion.


To compile:
===========

Edit makefiles to suit your machine, then do 'make' in the top
directory. This will make icclib and scarse binaries. By default,
icclib is compiled and linked to as a shared library. You might
have to rerun 'ldconfig' after it is installed to make ld.so find
it.


To install:
===========

Do 'make install' in the top directory. This will install icclib
and scarse binaries into directory specified by $(PREFIX) variable
in makefiles. Various data files required for operation (calibration
target specs and so on) are installed under $(PREFIX)/share/cms.
