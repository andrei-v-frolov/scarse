<H3>www.scarse.org is up</H3>

<P>Update your bookmarks! New homepage of Scarse project at
<A HREF="http://www.scarse.org">www.scarse.org</A> is finally up and
running. You will be redirected to new pages if you visit the old pages
at ohm.phys.ualberta.ca, as the old pages will be taken offline soon.

<H3>Scarse is coming to SourceForge</H3>

<P>Scarse project is coming out of the closet! After almost a year of
hiding in the shadows of <A HREF="http://ohm.phys.ualberta.ca/photo/">
my personal web pages</A>, it is going to bravely show itself to a
wider online audience. Please be gentle :)...

<P>Scarse is getting set up at <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net">
SourceForge</A>, and if everything works out well, will be hosted there
permanently. We also got our own domain name now (scarse.org), and will
be setting it up shortly (unless we run into unexpected difficulties,
as it often happens :).

<H3>Icclib bug found!</H3>

<P>Nasty bug in icclib found and fixed. All version 0.2-alpha users should
<A HREF="http://download.sourceforge.net/scarse/icclib-1.21-bugfix.gz">
patch their icclib</A> now, rather than wait for release 0.3. The bug
affects both accuracy and speed of reverse curve lookups.

<H3>Version 0.3 is in the works...</H3>

<P>Since I'm working on my PhD thesis right now, things are moving a
little bit slow. But the release 0.3 is not too far off in the future.
I've put a lot of work into optimizing profile generation algorithms,
and did a major rewrite of some internals. The 0.3 is going to be good
:)...

<P>In other news, there's talk about GUI... Pixel Fairy said he'd give
it a go once command line interface is frozen in 0.3. So maybe in
0.4... But, as usual, don't hold your breath :).

<H3>Version 0.2-alpha released!</H3>

<P>This release offers more supported calibration targets, improved
performance and various bugfixes over 0.1-alpha. The main difference,
though, is better color correction algorithm. It turned out that
multidimensional interpolation routines in 0.1 did not work as well as
advertised :). They were too stiff and either overshot horribly or
didn't do anything useful at all. Fancy variational methods my behind!
Replaced by proletarian linear simplex interpolation, which actually
works well for our data. Also, we now calculate matrix transform to
best-fit calibration data before doing interpolation. As a result of
these measures, saturation is brought under control, something 0.1 left
to hardware to decide upon. We are actually at the point when you can
scan Q60 on Polaroid SprintScan 4000 and el-cheapo HP Photosmart, run
them through Scarse profiles, and overall colors will look almost
identical!

<P>Also, release 0.2 does away with code inherited from certain
well-known book on numerical methods, which will remain unnamed.
Apparently, authors do not want anybody actually <I>using</I> their
code. Heaven forbid! Whether evil or just misguided in their licensing
policies, it's their decision to make, so numerics in Scarse have
undergone a rewrite. Hopefully, not too many new bugs were
introduced...

<H3>First bugs found!</H3>

<P>No software release goes out without bugs. Scarse is no exception.
Two bugs, one minor and one major, were discovered by John Pitney.
Thanks!

<P>The first bug is a TIFF byteorder issue for 16 bit/channel data. If
your only use files coming from your machine, or 8 bit/channel data,
this won't affect you.

<P>The major bummer is that ipb v0.1 chokes on degenerate data, such as
when highlights are blown out by the scanner or shadows are blocked. If
you encounter problems like "ipb: Bad input to interp_1d()", or run
into floating point exceptions, this is probably the cause. Email me
and I will send you a quick fix patch.

<P>Both bugs will be fixed in release 0.2-alpha, which is currently in
the works. It will also offer improved profile generation (currently
saturation is a bit low), and some new features. But don't hold your
breath...

<H3>Version 0.1-alpha released!</H3>

<P>The first public release of Scarse is out. Main functionality is in
place. Interface could use some work, most notably we need a GUI
frontend. Translation through ICC profiles is working. ICC profile
builder is working for profiles we need to calibrate scanner and
display. Scanner calibration for transparency or reflective media is
working. Generic display profiles work. The rest needs more work.
Enjoy!
