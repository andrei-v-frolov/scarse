Scarse (Scanner CAlibration ReaSonably Easy)  --  change log
============================================================

Version 0.3-alpha
  ** icclib updated to the latest version (v1.23 of 99/11/29)
  ** Nasty bug in icclib curve lookup code found and fixed;
     re-implementation resulted in enormous speed-ups!
  ** New object-oriented image IO wrapper library with:
      - support for TIFF and PPM (read-only)
      - cleaner and much more efficient implementation
      - correct packing of Lab TIFF files
      - new and exciting bugs :)
  ** User-defined option macros (long options) added to all commands
  ** Lots of improvements to cmap:
      - profile embedding support (requires libtiff v3.5)
      - option to generate preview (scaled-down) image
      - out of gamut warning with clipped pixel counter
      - a number of color adjustment options added
        (levels, curves, split contrast, center filter)
      - automatic adjustment algorithms to handle negative film
  ** calibrate has been almost completely rewritten; changes include:
      - new parser for IT8.7 files; target data is not precompiled anymore
      - target data files are now installed in a separate directory tree
      - user-supplied IT8.7 data files can be used with -b and -t
      - media Dmin is now mapped to white point as per ICC specs
      - pixel averaging changed to median-bracketed mean
      - display calibration code was not doing anything useful,
        and was removed to avoid confusion - run ipb directly instead
  ** Accuracy of ipb profile generation algorithm is significantly improved:
      - parameter fit is now with respect to perceptual metric
      - better polynomial fit is used if enough data is available
      - added an option to expand shadow portion of LUT
      - fixed a bug in interpolation code which was shifting blacks
      - added profile testing and error measurement code
  ** Sorted out RGB primaries mess - we are now in sync with Photoshop
  ** Default RGB space changed to Adobe RGB primaries/D50 white point
  ** Added recent Kodak calibration data files to distribution

Version 0.2-alpha
  ** Added support for Kodak Q13, Q14 and similar grayscale targets
  ** Added support for Gretag-MacBeth Color Checker calibration target
  ** Profile generation algorithm changes in ipb:
      - default PCS changed to XYZ (from Lab)
      - default rendering intent changed to perceptual
      - added best linear fit to calibration data stage
      - matrix-based profiles are now generated as well
      - interpolation changed to linear - actually works now
      - two options, -L and -M, added to control profile creation
  ** Fixed embarassing typo in spaces.c which screwed up blue primary
  ** Numerics rewritten to break free from any existing copyrights
  ** linalg.c no longer used, removed from distribution
  ** Use system random number generator instead of ran2.c
  ** Consistency check bug found (and fixed) in icclib
  ** Fixed degenerate calibration data handling in ipb
  ** Various code speedups

Version 0.1-alpha
  ** First public release
  ** Translation through profiles is working
  ** ICC profile builder is working
  ** Scanner calibration is working
