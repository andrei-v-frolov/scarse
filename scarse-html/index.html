Scarse project is currently <EM>under development</EM>. Beta-testers
and developers are sorely needed. I cannot do everything myself, I have
a day job :). If you interested and want to help, please contact me. My
email is all over this pages.

<B>02/11/1999</B>: Scarse <A HREF="released/scarse-0.2-alpha.tar.gz">version 0.2-alpha</A>
released (read more on <A HREF="/db/news/scarse">Scarse news page</A>).
Features new to 0.2 release:
<UL>
  <LI>Improved color correction - check updated <A HREF="images/">comparison images</A>
  <LI>All common calibration targets (Q60, Q13, Q14 and MacBeth) are now supported
  <LI>Generates better and smaller profiles, runs faster too
  <LI>Various bugs fixed
</UL>

<H3>What is it?</H3>

<P>
Scarse project was born out of my desire to be able to get good scans
which are consistent across large batches, and do it with minimal
amount of manual tweaking. It is intended for serious photographic
applications, and is most useful with high-end film scanners. If you
just want to occasionally scan a snapshot of your aunt on your $100
flatbed and don't care about the colors as long as they are snappy,
don't bother, this package is not for you.

<P> As the name implies, color management issues are rarely addressed
in the free software world, probably because until now good scanner
hardware was unaffordable to a mere mortal. However, for everything
there is a first, and I am proud to announce the first free scanner
calibration software available to the public, Scarse.

<P>
Scarse is developed for Unix machines and is distributed under the
terms of <A HREF="COPYING">GNU Public License</A>.

<P>
Right now, the Scarse is at early development stages, and is not as
polished as commercial systems are. Indeed, it is quite rough and even
downright inconvenient in places. However, it is quite functional
already, and produces transparency scans which are <A
HREF="images/">easily superior</A> to what I get from commercial
Polaroid SprintScan 4000 drivers (using the same hardware). Those of
you who are used to super-saturated output of typical consumer scanners
might be disappointed with Scarse scans, but what they lack in visual
punch, they more than make up in subtleness.

So if you are adventurous type, give it a try, and tell me what you
think...


<H3>How does it work?</H3>

<P>
It works quite well, thank you :). Oh, you meant technical details :)?

<P>
Scarse works by comparing the scan of a hardcopy reference calibration
target (such as <A HREF="q60tech.pdf">Kodak Q60</A>) coming from your
hardware to the actual colors the target is supposed to have. It then
builds (by interpolation) lookup tables that take into account the
measured scanner hardware peculiarities. Using thus generated profile,
you can then get scans with color rendition (more or less :)
independent of the particular hardware used.

<P>
You will need supported hardcopy calibration target. Kodak Q60 target
offers a lot of color points to measure and thus produces quite precise
profiles. It is <A HREF="q60order.pdf">available from Kodak</A> in 35mm
and 4x5 transparency, as well as 5x7 reflective formats. Other standard
calibration targets, such as Kodak Color Separation Guide Q13 & Q14, and
MacBeth Color Checker are also supported starting from version 0.2.
Scans from negatives are not directly supported yet (but you can include
MacBeth Color Checker in one of the frames and generate profile from
that).


<H3>Where do I find it?</H3>

<P>You have found it!
