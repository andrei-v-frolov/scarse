Scarse (Scanner CAlibration ReaSonably Easy)  --  to do list
============================================================

To do next:
===========

  -- Add color negative film calibration support
  -- Add display and printer calibration support
  -- Write GUI frontend to calibrate (using Gtk) - any takers?
  -- Implement profile embedding support in cmap
  -- Write some image tweaking tools (contrast & unsharp masks, etc)
  -- Update makefiles to use GNU Autoconf
  -- Write up documentation


To do sometime:
===============

  -- Make cmap and calibrate into Gimp plugins
     (this would have to wait until Gimp supports different color
      spaces and more than 8 bits/channel)
